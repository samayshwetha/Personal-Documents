1)What is AUTOMATION?
-Converting Manual Test Cases into Automation TestScripts by using Automation Tool is called as Automation

2)When we will go for Automation ?
-Automation always takes place on stable application.
-Application becomes stable when first release done for that application.
-Hence after release we should go for Automation.

3)Why should we go for Automation?
-For Repeative task which take place in Regression Testing.
-Time saving from Second release
-Accuracy of testing increases
-To sustain in market compitation.

4)What type of testing take place in Automation?
-Regression Testing

5)Is 100% Automation is possible?
-No

6)What is not Automatted?
-Otp releated scenarios
-Capcha releated scenarios
-Virtual keyboard
-Bio matric
-Audio,video releated Testcases
-Voice commands
-Gamming application
-If manual testcases steps are improper than that testcases are not automated.

 Automation Tool are categorized into two divisions--  @Commercial
                                                       @OpenSource

Commercial software --> commercial software has the source code(business logic written by developer)
 that only the person,team or organization that created it can edit,inspect,change and enhance/update 
it apart from them no one has access to do changes.

commercial tool ex:
QTP -->QTP stands for QuickTestProfessional, a product of Hewlett Packard(HP) and its a GUI tool.
         QTP tool helps testers to perform an automated functional testing.
         QTP supports only Windows OS
         QTP supports only two languages Java script and Visual Basic script.
         QTP doesnot support safari browser.

open source software --> open source software is computer software with its source code made available 
by the developer or organization to everybody to study,change,modify,enhance and distribute.

open source tool ex:
Selenium Webdriver
Sikuli
AutoIT

                                                    SELENIUM
It is a open source tool which is used to test webapplications and mobile applications.

To perform webapps automation we use Selenium WebDriver.
To perform mobile application automation we use Appium.(WebDriver is basics and mandatory to learn appium).

                                          What are the flavours/Edition of Selenium?
1.Selenium core(not at all currently used)Depreciated
2.Selenium RC(not at all currently used)Depreciated
3.Selenium IDE          Record and Playback Tool.(Actions will be recorded of webpages)
                        No need to know any programming language(Automatically scripts are written) and for simple applications 
it can be used but for complex applications we cannot use.

4.Selenium WebDriver    (Advanced version of selenium core and RC) and current version of selenium is 4 released in november.
5.Selenium Grid         Helps to automate scripts on multiple machines or computer so execution will be faster.
6.Appium                Mobile automation tool.

What is previous stable version of selenium webdriver?
-->3.141.59


Advantages of Selenium Automation Tool?
-->Open source tool.

-->Supports multiple programming languages.
                                           (java,C#,Python,Ruby,Perl,haskell,Go,Dart,Javascript........)

-->Supports multiple browsers.
                              (chrome,firefox,opera,Internet Explorer,MS EDGE,Safari)

Disadvantages of selenium?
-->We cannot automate stand alone applications/Window GUI apps like calculator,notepad..etc..

 What are difference between selenium and QTP?
-->selenium                                                 	QTP
           1. It supports multiple OS                           It supports only WINDOWS OS
           2. It supports multiple Prog Lang                    It supports only 2 lang javascript and visual basic script.
           3. It supports multiple browsers on multiple OS      Doesnot support safari browser.   
           4. It supports on WebApps.                           It supports all types of applications.
           5. open source                                       Licensed Tool.

Which company developed selenium?
-->ThoughtWorks

Who is the father of selenium?
-->Jason Huggins(He developed Selenium core since initially he developed but advanced version is selenium webdriver was working at thought works)

What is official website of selenium?
-->WWW.SeleniumHQ.org  (earlier)
   but in 2019,they created new website www.selenium.dev  (To download ,check documents)

What is the name of the latest version of selenium?
-->W3C WebDriver(Selenium webdriver)
   W3--world wide web
   C--consortium--its a kind of forum..
when discussing about architecture will explain detailly about w3c\

                      How selenium works?/Architecture of selenium webdriver
                     --------------------------------------------------------
Json wire protocol architecture(Selenium prev)

*For succesfull configuration of WebDriver Automation tool we required--
1) WebDriver Client Library
2) Browser Server
3) Actual Browser

WebDriver client Library  
------------------------
->Entire WebDriver libraries are available in the form of jars.(jar stands for JavaArchive and its an executable file format like .exe    etc....)
->In order to access the jars in our project,we have to configure this jar with our automation project.
->This WebDriver jar is totally collection of java class and interface.
->Within this jar we will get Json wire protocol which is required for communication between our testsccipts 
and Browser server.

Browser Server
----------------
->Browser server is an webService(All the services over web(cloud) is called as WebService) which is used to interact with actual browsers
(chrome,firefox,etc.....).
->Without browser server,script will never interact with actual browsers.
->Each and every browser has individual Browser servers.

Actual Browser
---------------
->Browsers are stand alone applications which is used to access webApplications.
(StandAlone appln means which is installed in the local sytem and only one user can use at a time examples notepad,vlc media player.......)
->Browsers must be installed in local system in order to run test scripts with that particular browser...

              How selenium 4 works?
          ---------------------------------
->As per selenium 4 ,jsonwire  protocol is replaced by W3C standard protocol.
->As per recent updation Browser servers and all browsers are operating on W3C protocol only.
->Due to this change ie with W3C protocol,
w3c--> world wide web consortium
                                          1) Conversion rate of code is minimized.
                                          2) Speed of execution is increased.

                                     	Selenium-java architecture

1)Search Context (Interface)
   -->It Provides search mechanism to search the elements in the webpage.
   -->It is an interface which contains only two abstract methods.
      findElement() -->To search single element. 
      findElements() -->To search multiple elements. 

2)Selenium WebDriver(Interface)
   -->It provides a way to control the Browser.
   -->It is the core interface of selenium,without which we cannot start automation because it contains main browser controlling methods.
   -->It is an interface which has 11 abstract methods.   namely...

      1. get("") -->It is used to navigate particular URL(website) and wait till page load.
      2. getTitle() -->It will capture the current started page heading and later it will be saved in a variable and next
 it will be published in the console.
      3. getCuurentUrl() -->It fetches the URL of the opened application.
      4. getPageSource() -->It returns the source code of the page which stored as string.
      5. getWindowHandle() -->It is used to handle child windows.
      6. getWindowHandles() -->It is used to store all the opened window handles in the set data structure.
      7. close() -->It is used to close the browser window currently in focus.
      8. quit() -->It is used to close all the entire browser session with all its tabs and windows.
      9. navigate() -->It is used to perform different operations such as backward,forward,refresh,wait....etc in browsers history.
      10. manage() -->It is a method that returns instance/object of options interface.
      11. switchTo() -->It allows users to switch to a particular frame using frameId/window using  session Id.

3)Remote WebDriver(concrete class)
     -->It is an implementation concrete class for interfaces in selenium and also it is mainly used to run the testscripts 
from the host/local computer to the remote computer(selenium grid).
