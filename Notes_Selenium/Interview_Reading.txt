5.In xpath we can use multiple attributes    In css we can't use multiple attributes

3. Implicit Wait vs. Explicit Wait
The implicit and explicit wait is used to wait for an element to appear on the page. However, there are some differences between them:

Timeouts: Implicit wait sets a default timeout for the entire test runtime, while explicit wait sets timeouts for specific conditions.
Condition: Implicit wait waits for an element to appear on the page, while explicit wait waits for a specific condition, such as the presence of an element or the element to be clickable.
Scope: Implicit wait applies globally, while explicit wait applies locally to a specific element.
Exception: Implicit wait throws a NoSuchElementException when the WebDriver cannot find the element within the specified timeout. In contrast, explicit wait throws a TimeoutException when the element doesnâ€™t meet the condition within the specified timeout.
The implicit wait is helpful when we want to wait a certain amount of time for elements to appear on the page. However, the explicit wait is the better option if we need to wait for a specific condition.
