Data Driven Testing: Automation rule says never hard code any data
                     Store the required data in any external resources and read that in the test 
                     test script
-> Common Data: data which is common to all the test scripts like url, username, 
                passowrd, browser name.
                -> Property File is more prefered
                -> Property File is light weight
                -> property file stores the data in key value pair
                -> Easy to read the data
                -> Disadvantge :Not organised hence its preffered only for small amount of data
-> Test Data: data which is specific to only to the test case like 
              Create Organization -- Organization name
              Create Contact -- Contact name
              Create Contact With Organization -- Contact Name and Organization name
              -> To store test data we prefer Excel sheet
              -> excel sheet stores data in the form of rows and columns
              -> Data is stored in a well organised way so that data retrieval becomes easy
              -> Data maintainace is easy 
              -> Disadvantage is excel sheet is slow comapared to property File
