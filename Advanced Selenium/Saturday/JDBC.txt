JDBC:
1. What are the steps to connect to database?
2. Expalin JDBC architecture/Class diagram of JDBC. 
3. What are the advantages of JDBC?
   -> JDBC helps to connect any database from java program
   -> JDBC helps to automate preconditions
   -> JDBC helps to automate end to end scenarios
   -> JDBC helps for partial backend automation
   -> JDBC helps for database related validations
4. Why JDBC is required for Developers?
   -> Any Application should have its physical database to store the data
   -> Developers use JDBC to communicate with the database
   -> If java program has to coonect with db then JDBC is like a bridge. 
5. What is the use of JDBC for automation testers?
   -> JDBC is required to automate the pre conditions
      - Scenario:
        Test Scenario says we have to transfer 10000 rupees from account A to account B
        Pre condition for above scenario is 10000 rupees should be presnt in account A
        If we know JDBC, we can connect to database via program and automate the pre condition also
        This increases the number of automatable test cases.
   -> JDBC is required to automate End to end Scenarios
     - Scenario:
       Test scenario says we have add the product to the cart and verify if the product is 
       successfylly added in the cart table of database.
       if we know JDBC, we can connect to database via program and execute a select query 
       and validate if the data is present or not.
       This increases number of automatable scenarios.
