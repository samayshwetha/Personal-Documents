Generic Utilities/Generic Library/Generic Utils/Common Utils
 - This is a package created in src/main/java source folder 
 - It is used to store all the generic classes and interfaces
 - Methods written in generic classes should not be hardcoded, they should be generic
 - What ever data we need to write the generic method should be parameterised
 - What ever data generic method should give back to the caller method should be returned.
 - based on the data to be returned, the return type of generic method is decided
 - if no data has to be returned to the caller function, the return type of generic method
   will be void
 - Generic Utility is common for all the projects.
 - Generic Utility will be created/designed by framework developers 
 - Generic Utility contains all the re usable methods like getRandomNumber(), getdate(),
   handleDropDown()
